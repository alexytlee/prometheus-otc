                Digital asset trading involves a high degree of risk. The
                digital asset market is new and unproven and may not grow.
                Currently, there is relatively small use of digital assets in
                the retail and commercial marketplace in comparison to
                relatively large use by speculators, thus contributing to price
                volatility that could adversely affect an investment in crypto
                assets. In order to participate in the trading of digital
                assets, you should be capable of evaluating the merits and risks
                of the investment and be able to bear the economic risk of
                losing your entire investment. No material on this site should
                be considered as an offer by Prometheus Global Limited to sell

                Risk Disclosure Statement Buying and selling Digital Assets can
                involve various risks. You can suffer Loss and that is a risk
                you should be able to take. If you do not understand the risks
                or are not willing to accept the risks or suffer Loss, you
                should not enter into transactions with Prometheus Global
                Limited. Before transacting, you must carefully assess and
                consider the risks, including those contained in any documents
                we make available to you and obtain all necessary professional
                advice you need. You must decide for yourself whether you should
                participate in any transaction. Unless Prometheus Global Limited
                has agreed to do so in writing or applicable law requires us to
                do so, Prometheus Global Limited is not required to advise you
                on any transaction, protect your exposure to Loss or provide any
                warnings to you. You must carefully consider and monitor your
                own transactions. You must also understand and arrange
                appropriate custody for your Digital Assets. Unless otherwise
                agreed by us in writing, anything Prometheus Global Limited,
                including any of its officers, employees or agents, may say to
                you is opinion only. You must not rely on it or hold Prometheus
                Global Limited liable for it, even if it is wrong. Similarly,
                you must not hold Prometheus Global Limited liable if Prometheus
                Global Limited fails to give you advice or recommendations or to
                prevent Losses. Prometheus Global will not be liable for your
                Losses in any circumstances, except as required by applicable
                law. By using Prometheus Global’s service, you acknowledge that
