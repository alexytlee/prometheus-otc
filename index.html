                Digital asset trading involves a high degree of risk. The
                digital asset market is new and unproven and may not grow.
                Currently, there is relatively small use of digital assets in
                the retail and commercial marketplace in comparison to
                relatively large use by speculators, thus contributing to price
                volatility that could adversely affect an investment in crypto
                assets. In order to participate in the trading of digital
                assets, you should be capable of evaluating the merits and risks
                of the investment and be able to bear the economic risk of
                losing your entire investment. No material on this site should
